### As we're sharing a .cs file now, here are some protocols that it would be advisable to follow to minimize frustration (feel free to add your own):
## -Push comments declaring that you're working on a section before you start working on it, remove the comment once you finish.
## -Don't work on a section that someone else is currently working on
## -Be very careful with pulls/pushes/fetches/etc, we don't want to step on other code or have our code stepped on
