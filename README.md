### As we're sharing a .cs file now, here are some protocols that it would be advisable to follow to minimize frustration (I barely understand anything about github or standard collaborative coding protocol, feel free to update this with better/standard protocols):
## -Push comments declaring that you're working on a section before you start working on it, remove the comment once you finish.
## -Don't work on a section that someone else is currently working on
## -Be very careful with pulls/pushes/fetches/etc, we don't want to step on other code or have our code stepped on
## -Maybe utilize branches when developing a section? (i.e create a new branch to work on that section, merge when finished)
